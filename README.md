# Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam Guide

This is my collections of exam note and study guide for _Cloud Native Computing Foundation CNCF Certificate Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)_. The structure of this note is based on [CKA Curriculum v.1.24](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKA_Curriculum_v1.24.pdf) as published by CNCF.

## Before we start

This repository assumes the reader has some basic understanding of Linux as an operation system and familiarity with navigating and editing text via Linux command lines.

All materials from this exam guide is taken and solely documented from [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io). Each chapter or submodule will have a direct link to the relevant component on official kubernetes doc. Important fundamental concepts will be covered as short as possible to aid the reader in refreshing the concept. It is not meant to replace a full Kubernetes course nor full documentation.

The reader is expected to be familiar with navigating this official docs; as this is the one of the only available resource you have access to during proctored exam.

**Chapter 0 - Kubernetes Basic** is not an assessable components of the _CKA Exam_ and only serve as a basic introduction to Kubernetes and its mission.
